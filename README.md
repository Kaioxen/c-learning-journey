## About This Journey

A practical exploration of C programming within unique constraints, driven by curiosity and systematic learning. Every compiled program represents a step toward deeper system understanding.

**Development Environment:**
- Device: Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A (3GB available storage)
- Platform: Ubuntu 22.04 via chroot on Android 10
- Compiler: GCC 11.4.0 (aarch64 architecture)
- Approach: Understanding over memorization, consistency over intensity

## Current Progress

### Level 1: Variables & Basic I/O (Completed)
- [x] Hello World & basic printf usage
- [x] Integer, float, and character variables  
- [x] Format specifiers (%d, %f, %c, %s)
- [x] Basic arithmetic operations in C

### Level 2: Control Flow (In Progress)
- [ ] Conditional statements (if/else)
